NEED:
PYQT 5
QT Designer

Instructions:
if you open the .ui files, it'll show xml code. 
Convert it first into .py file by following these steps:
1.) open cmd and change directory to the folder that has the .ui files
2.) type this: pyuic5 -x insert_name_of_File_here.ui -o insert_output_name_of_File_here.py
3.) press enter. It'll create the .py file on the directory.


NOTE: 

converting it into a .py file lets you know the objects to be called and used for editing.
Example would be text fields.

tl;dr
you use the converted py file as a guideline for the objects you'll modify as you write the logic.

WARNING!!!
if you make changes on the .ui file, you must convert it again to the .py
you are free to edit the .py as long as the design is finalized on the .ui file and you wont make any changes there anymore.
This is purely for avoiding the hassle of converting it again and again every time you make changes with the .ui file.
